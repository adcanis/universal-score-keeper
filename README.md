# Universal Score Keeper


![alt text](https://github.com/adcanis/universal-score-keeper/blob/main/imgs/scorekeeperReadMe.jpg)


This is a project created for the Colt Steele Bootcamp and features my first experience with Bulma. 

Having used bootstrap before I felt very comfortable implementing this into this tool. This also kept my lessons and practice going with Javascript and is a representation of my earliest work with it.

and as always

**Thanks for looking**
